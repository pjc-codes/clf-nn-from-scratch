# From-Scratch Multiclass Neural Network (NumPy)

This repository contains a from-scratch implementation of a multiclass neural network using only NumPy.
The goal is pedagogical correctness and understanding of the core concepts, not performance.

The model is trained on a 2D dataset and implements explicit forward and backward propagation, including manual gradient calculations for all parameters.
